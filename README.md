# Stat Tracker Web App

This web app is designed for people who play Counter Strike: Global Offensive to be able to keep track of their stats from match to match and monitor their progression with different stats such as KD ratio, utility usage, assists, and more. It allows for the user to input their stats after each match and then be able to track their overall kill-death ratio (a feature that CS:GO does not have) and measure their improvement in other stats over time periods. 

This web app allows for users to create their own account to keep their stats separate from other users. They can then manually add the stats from each match after they finish and the web app will keep all of their info stores in a database. This allows for long-term storage of stats for the user.
